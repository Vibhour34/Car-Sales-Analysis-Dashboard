SQL Querying: Multiple SQL queries were performed on the database to filter, aggregate, and transform the data as per the requirements of the dashboard. This included calculations for metrics like total revenue, market share, and most expensive cars etc.

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

Data Transformation: Necessary data transformations were applied, such as creating calculated columns for derived metrics and pivoting data for better visualization.
The preprocessed data was then loaded into Power BI for creating the interactive dashboard.
